		\begin{description}[abc]  % for indentation of length of abc
  			\item[$\bullet$] Should you require more levels, use \texttt{description} instead of \texttt{itemize}.
        	\begin{description}[abc]  % for indentation of length of abc
  				\item[$\bullet$] Note: Please try not to write too much copy onto your slides.

\subsection{Mathematics}

\begin{frame}{Readable Mathematics}

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
